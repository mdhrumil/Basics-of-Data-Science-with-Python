# Basics-of-Data-Science-with-Python
The repository contains notes about basic concepts required to get started with Machine Learning and Data Science. I myself created this notes while I was learning so they are conspicuously meant for beginners and neophytes. Additional edits, inclusions and changes to the notes are much appreciated. Please give it a star if you felt the notes useful.
